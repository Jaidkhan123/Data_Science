    "\n",
    "it's important to close files in Python. Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data.\n",

    "Python doesn't flush the buffer—that is, write data to the file—until it's sure you're done writing, and one way to do this is to close the file. If you write to a file without closing, the data won't make it to the target file."
