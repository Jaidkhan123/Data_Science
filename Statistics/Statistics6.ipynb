    "To calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean, we'll use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval = Sample Mean ± (Critical Value * (Standard Deviation / √Sample Size))\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- Population mean (μ) = 60\n",
    "- Population standard deviation (σ) = 8\n",
    "- Sample size (n) = 50\n",
    "- Sample mean (x̄) = 65\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's calculate the critical value corresponding to a 90% confidence level. We can use the z-score from the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 90% confidence level, the critical z-value can be obtained from a standard normal distribution table or using statistical software. The critical z-value for a 90% confidence level is approximately 1.645.\n",

    "`Interpretation`:\n",
    "Based on the sample data, we can be 90% confident that the true population mean falls within the range of approximately 63.22 to 66.78. This means that if we were to repeat the sampling process and construct confidence intervals, approximately 90% of those intervals would contain the true population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true population mean based on the sample data. It quantifies the uncertainty associated with the estimate and helps us understand the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean."

    "Based on the results of the t-test, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level. The sample data indicates a substantial difference between the average reaction time observed and the hypothesized population mean of 0, indicating that caffeine has an impact on reaction time."
