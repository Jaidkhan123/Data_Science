    "Q)1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans->Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading refers to concurrently executing multiple threads by rapidly switching the control of the CPU between threads (called context switching).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple, single-core CPU, it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. This is termed as context switching. In context switching, the state of a thread is saved and state of another thread is loaded whenever any interrupt (due to I/O or manually set) takes place. Context switching takes place so frequently that all the threads appear to be running parallelly (this is termed as multitasking).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python multithreading is used because it enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory. Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks. It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threading module is used for creating, controlling and managing threads in python."

    "\n",
    "Ans-> Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time. Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threading module is used for creating, controlling and managing threads in python.\n",
