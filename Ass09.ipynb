    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a class called \"Car\" which has various attributes like \"model\", \"color\",\n",

    "Abstraction can be achieved by creating an abstract class called \"Vehicle\" which defines the\n",

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-> Abstract base classes provide a way to define interfaces when other techniques like hasattr() would be clumsy or subtly wrong (for example with magic methods). ABCs introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that don’t inherit from a class but are still recognized by isinstance() and issubclass() functions. There are many built-in ABCs in Python. ABCs for Data structures like Iterator, Generator, Set, mapping etc. are defined in collections.abc module. The numbers module defines numeric tower which is a collection of base classes for numeric data types. The 'abc' module in Python library provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used as the main goal of the abstract base class is to provide a standardized way to test whether an object adheres to a given specification. It can also prevent any attempt to instantiate a subclass that doesn’t override a particular method in the superclass. And finally, using an abstract class, a class can derive identity from another class without any object inheritance."

    "An abstract method is a method that is declared, but does not contain implementation. An abstract method in a base class identifies the functionality that should be implemented by all its subclasses. However, since the implementation of an abstract method would differ from one subclass to another, often the method body comprises just a pass statement. Every subclass of the base class will ride this method with its implementation. A class containing abstract methods is called abstract class.Python provides the abc module to use the abstraction in the Python program, syntax as:\n",
