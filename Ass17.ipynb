    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-> API stands for application programming interface, which is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone. Weather data is a popular API example that we come across regularly. Rich weather snippets appear ubiquitous, appearing on all platforms such as Google Search, Apple's Weather app, and even your smart home device.\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses."

    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans->The main advantage of providing an API is that it allows your users to do more with your product or service (i.e. it increases the value of your product). This typically takes one of two forms -\n",
    "\n",
    "1) An integration :\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an integration is to push notifications from your product (such as CRM, Helpdesk) to a messaging tool such as Slack. In this way, if your customer uses Slack they can receive notifications without having to login directly to your system or check emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) New functionality :\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early days of Twitter, some of the most popular Twitter clients were produced by third parties using the Twitter API. Twitter and its users benefited from the new functionality that was undertaken by other companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages to providing an API are,\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Cost :\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing an API is expensive in terms of development time, ongoing maintenance, providing API documentation on your website and providing support to users of your API.\n",
    "2) Security exposure :\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding an API adds another attack surface to your website.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) You might not like the result or you may change business direction :\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not always easy to predict exactly how your API will be used. If your integration with a messaging system means that users login to your service less often, will there be an overall negative impact for you? Withdrawing an API can be painful for users if you decide that you need to do so. This is unusual but it can happen. As Twitter's business evolved it changed its rules for accessing its API which resulted in a number of problems for users and developers"

    "Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-> Web API as the name suggests, is an API over the web which can be accessed using HTTP protocol. It is a concept and not a technology. We can build Web API using different technologies such as Java, .NET etc. For example, Twitter's REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write data using which we can integrate twitter's capabilities into our own application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between Api and web api is that Both APIs and web services are technologies that enable the transfer of data between separate software applications. API is an interface that exposes an application's data to outside software, whereas web applications are one type of API with stricter requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Web api is a collection of open source protocols and standards used for exchanging data between systems or applications, whereas API is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web api is used for REST, SOAP, and XML-RPC for communication, while API is used for any style of communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web api supports only HTTP protocol, whereas API supports HTTP/HTTPS protocol."

    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-> REST: representational state transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is a set of architectural principles attuned to the needs of lightweight web services and mobile applications. Because it's a set of guidelines, it leaves the implementation of these recommendations to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a request for data is sent to a REST API, it’s usually done through hypertext transfer protocol (commonly referred to as HTTP). Once a request is received, APIs designed for REST (called RESTful APIs or RESTful web services) can return messages in a variety of formats: HTML, XML, plain text, and JSON. JSON (JavaScript object notation) is favored as a message format because it can be read by any programming language (despite the name), is human- and machine-readable, and is lightweight. In this way, RESTful APIs are more flexible and can be easier to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a standard protocol that was first designed so that applications built with different languages and on different platforms could communicate. Because it is a protocol, it imposes built-in rules that increase its complexity and overhead, which can lead to longer page load times. However, these standards also offer built-in compliances that can make it preferable for enterprise scenarios. The built-in compliance standards include security, atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), which is a set of properties for ensuring reliable database transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of Soap :\n",
    "\n",
    "1) SOAP only uses XML. It doesn’t take other formats like JSON into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) There is a high possibility of coupling between client and server as SOAP is based on contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Since it uses XML format, SOAP is considered to be a slow platform because the payload is large for a simple string message.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Any change in server contract is reflected in client stub classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) SOAP is hard to test in browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) SOAP clients do not hold any stateful references to remote objects."

    "Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-> Many legacy systems may still adhere to SOAP, while REST came later and is often viewed as a faster alternative in web-based scenarios. REST is a set of guidelines that offers flexible implementation, whereas SOAP is a protocol with specific requirements like XML messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs are lightweight, making them ideal for newer contexts like the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile application development, and serverless computing. SOAP web services offer built-in security and transaction compliance that align with many enterprise needs, but that also makes them heavier. Additionally, many public APIs, like the Google Maps API, follow the REST guidelines."
