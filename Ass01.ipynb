    "5-> Is Python code compiled or Interpreted ?\n",
    "Ans-> Python is both compiled as well as an interpreted language, which means when we run a python code, it is first compiled         and then interpreted line by line.\n",

    "    2) heap memory\n",

    "    The methods calls and the references are stored in stack memory and all the values objects are stored in a private heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Work of Stack Memory ->\n",
    "    The allocation happens on contiguous blocks of memory. We call it stack memory allocation because the allocation happens in     the function call stack. The size of memory to be allocated is known to the compiler and whenever a function is called, its     variables get memory allocated on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is the memory that is only needed inside a particular function or method call. When a function is called, it is added         onto the programâ€™s call stack. Any local memory assignments such as variable initializations inside the particular functions     are stored temporarily on the function call stack, where it is deleted once the function returns, and the call stack moves       on to the next task. This allocation onto a contiguous block of memory is handled by the compiler using predefined routines,     and developers do not need to worry about it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Work of Heap Memory ->\n",
    "    The memory is allocated during the execution of instructions written by programmers. Note that the name heap has nothing to     do with the heap data structure. It is called heap because it is a pile of memory space available to programmers to             allocated and de-allocate. The variables are needed outside of method or function calls or are shared within multiple           functions globally are stored in Heap memory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    we also have a Garbage collector in python.\n",
    "    Garbage collection is a process in which the interpreter frees up the memory when not in use to make it available for other     objects.\n",
    "    Assume a case where no reference is pointing to an object in memory i.e. it is not in use so, the virtual machine has a         garbage collector that automatically deletes that object from the heap memory.\n",

    "Ans-> 1) open your browser\n",

    "16-> Is indentation required in python.\n",
    "Ans-> Yes, indentation required in python.\n",
    "      Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
    "      Python indentation is a way of telling a Python interpreter that the group of statements belongs to a particular block of       code."
